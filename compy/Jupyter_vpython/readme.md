# J Wang, Computational modeling and visualization with Python

The zip file contains programs modified from classic VPython versions. They
are intended to run with vpython under Jupyter notebook in Anaconda or Canopy.
Install vpython for the programs to work.
The programs include the new library vpmnb.py, in place of vpm.py.
Other library modules are here, as well as at
http://www.faculty.umassd.edu/j.wang/book


From a user's perspective, generally two changes are made:
(1) Replace "import visual as vp, vpm" with "import vpython as vp, vpmnb as vpm"
(2) Change tuples to vectors, e.g., color=(1,1,1) to color=vp.vector(1,1,1)

Non-VPython programs are unaffected.
