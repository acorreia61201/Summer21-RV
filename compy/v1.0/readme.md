This folder contains original version 1.0 files that had been updated
to improve `input()` function compatibility between Python 2.xx and 3.xx
so they work under both versions. Newer versions are found in their respective chapter folders.

Programs 9.7 and 9.8 now uses binary mode for pickle dump and load operations so as to be compatible with Python 3.xx.
