# Summer21-RV

This directory contains the work done during Summer 2021 on radial velocity fitting in Python.

./Ch4Exercises contains programs used to complete the supplementary exercises in Chapter 4 of the textbook "Computational Modeling and Visualization with Python".

./compy contains all of the programs used in the aforementioned textbook as well as the custom libraries used by these programs. compy/ch04 contains the most relevant
programs for RV fitting.

./RVFitting contains a program that converts the FWF data from NASA Exoplanet Archive to RV vs time plots, which are then used to estimate RV fits using the methods 
described in the aforementioned textbook. Three examples are contained within, with a dataset and corresponding plot with fitting supplied for each confirmed
exoplanet.
